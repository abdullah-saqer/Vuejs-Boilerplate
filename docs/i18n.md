# Internationalization (i18n)


### we use &nbsp; [vue-i18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n) plugin.

### check the &nbsp; [Documentation](http://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/en/).

## global translation files

for global files we decide to not include it hard coded in the application so the bundle size will be smaller, for that we will request all global translations when the application launched. and all this requests done by lang modules in store folder:

as a note, why we will use vuex for languages ?

##### because we need the current language to be known for all our pages and components "i will be able to change the language from any page in the application"

in lang.js file we have one state "lang", one mutation "SET_LANG" and two actions "setLang, changeLang"

- SET_LANG mutation: update the lang state to new value
``` js
  SET_LANG (state, langPayload) {
    state.lang = langPayload;
  }
```

- setLang action: used for request all translations if it's not included.
``` js
  setLang({ commit }, langPayload) {
    // check if the requested language exists in i18n plugin
    if (langPayload in i18n.messages) {
      // if yes, we don't need to fetch it from global json
      // update i18n language "if translation read text from en.json it will be switched to ar.json"
      i18n.locale = langPayload;
      // commit will envok SET_LANG mutation and this is only update state lang
      commit(SET_LANG, langPayload);
    } else {
      // if the language not exist we need to fetch it as the following
      axios.get(`/static/${langPayload}.json`)
      .then(messages => {
        // when messages fetched we need to marge it with existin one
        // before : messages : {en: {..}}
        // after : messages : {en: {..}, ar:{..}}
        i18n.mergeLocaleMessage(langPayload, messages.data);
        // update lang in i18n plugin
        i18n.locale = langPayload;
        // update lang in state
        commit(SET_LANG, langPayload);
      })
      .catch(err => {console.log(err);})
    }
  }
```
we will call this action before enter any route for check the language

- changeLang action: used for just switch between languages
``` js
  changeLang({ commit }, langPayload) {
    // we need router here because we reflect our current language on URL eg. /en/about
    // here we will get the current path and switch between languages eg. "/en/about" will be "/ar/about"
    // replace function will find the first lang and replace it
    const switchedPath = router.currentRoute.path.replace(state.lang, langPayload);
    // check if the route exists
    if(router.currentRoute.name) {
      // if it is in routes, we will push the switched path
      router.push({path: switchedPath});
    }
    // update lang in i18n plugin
    state.lang = langPayload;
    // update lang in state
    commit(SET_LANG, langPayload);
  }
```

## in component translations

there is two types of translation in the application
1. Global Translation: fetched from static files to reduce the bundle size
2. Local Translation (in component): we will store the local translation in the same page

###### Why the local translations will not fetched from static files as the global ?

because we use [lazy loading](https://router.vuejs.org/en/advanced/lazy-loading.html) to load each page in the application, so in this case we also reduce the bundle size be splitting our application to chunks and each one will be requested if required

##### How to apply local translation:

in your .vue page you need to do this
``` vue
  <template>
    ...
  </template>
  <script>
    data() {
      return {
        ...
      }
    },
    methods: {
      ...
    },
    // here we add i18n property and define messages inside it
    // for each language, add require and it's point to language folder in i18n directory
    // this require statement is only for wepback, so when webpack bundles the application
    // it's will replace all file with it's content.
    i18n: {
      messages: {
        en: require('@/i18n/en/about.json'),
        ar: require('@/i18n/ar/about.json')
      }
    }
  </script>
```
after that you must define your json files in i18n directory and include all translation you need for this page

## Connect languages in the router

you can check the [router](/router) documentation and structure in the application.

here we define the root route as a param for lang and all default routes as a children to this route

``` js
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/:lang',
      component: { template: '<router-view/>' },
      children: [{...}]
    }
  ]
```

and in beforeEach global router guard
``` js
  router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
    // "to" is the next page
    // first we get the lang param from router eg. en, ar
    const lang = to.params.lang;
    // get path eg. /en/about
    const path = to.path;
    // first we check the lang param if it's defined
    if(lang) {
      // second if the lang defined we check if it's value equal one of our languages eg. /en
      if(lang in config.lang.languages) {
        // here we envok setLang action and send the lang to update it
        store.dispatch('setLang', lang)
          .then(done => {
            next();
          });
      } else {
        // if lang value not equal one of our languages eg. https://domain/about => here we doesn't send the lang param so it's will be "about"
        // in this case we get the lang from our store and merge it with path, so it will be /en/about
        next({path: `/${store.getters.lang}${path}`});
      }
    } else {
      // if there is no lang param we redirect the user to /en
      next({path: `/${store.getters.lang}`});
    }
  })
```
